# Umbrella Academy API
Umbrella Academy is an American time travel superhero streaming television series. I made this RESTful API for the fans. It contains the names, nicknames and pictures of all the current characters in Umbrella Academy.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS

My learning was focused on creating and consuming RESTful API. I was able to create the API so I deployed it to Heroku. I used fetch to consume the API on this site: https://umbrella-academy-characters.netlify.app.

## How to Run Code on Your Computer:

1. Make sure you have Node installed. You can check if you have node installed by running this code in your Command Line "$ node -v".
2. Install the library as a dependency using "npm install < git repo url>

## Optimizations

I would like to use Bootstrap to speed up the development process. I would also like to use EJS to insert variables directly in the HTML file.

## Lessons Learned:

I wasn't able to consume the API on my local server due to cors issue. I learnt how to import cors module into my server.js file to fix that issue.
